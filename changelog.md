Version 5.0.7

<details>
 
  **ADDED**  
  
  - Clockwork - No Lockpick Activate (SKSE) Patch  
  - Wynter's Breezehome - Wintersun - Legacy of the Dragonborn Patch
  
  **UPDATED**
  
  - Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch  
  - Completionist - Skyrim Completion Tracker  
  - Simply Order Summons  
  - Swiftly Order Squad  
  - Spell Perk Item Distributor (SPID)  
  - Simplicity of Snow  
  - Icy Windhelm  
   
  **FIXED**
  
  - Deep Elf item values were ridiculous. Most are now 10% of what they were; some are even lower.  
  - Deep Elf item crafting was a bit ridiculous. No more clearing one dungeon and coming out with 900+ dwarven ingots.  
  - Grand champion helm was invisible on equip.  
  - Butterflies in Shivering Isles were upside down, just like vanilla.  
  - Missing controller config files.  
  - Disabled Strange Runes shadow casting. Should fix lighting crashes.  
  
  **DISMISS ANY SUMMONS YOU HAVE ACTIVE PRIOR TO UPDATING.**

  - Controller-mapping Unbound  
  - Silver Armor and Weapons Retexture SE  
  - Septentrional Landscapes 2K  
  - Northern Shores 2K  
  - Snow - HD Texture Replacer with Parallax

  <b>REMOVED</b>
  
  - The Omnibus - Terrain Complex Parallax AiO  
  - Tundra - HD Texture Replacer with Parallax  
  
  <b>UPDATED</b>
  
  - Skyland AIO
  
  <b>FIXED</b>
  
  - Refinalized navmeshes to successfully complete the door link from the Soul Cairn to Apocrypha. Valerica will no longer get stuck during the Beyond Death quest in Dawnguard.  
  - The "Return to Breezehome" spell has several issues. First, there was a typo in the description. That's fixed. Second, it teleported you into the Armory room, which is a purchasable upgrade. Now it will teleport you into the main area instead of the Armory, so you should no longer be stuck inside.  
  - Breezehome Exterior purchasable upgrade was revamped instead of removed. Now the landscape pieces will be enabled by default, and the upgrade you purchase will be for the furniture, rugs, lights, and things like that.  
  - Snowy treasure chests had weird textures.  
  - Iron gauntlets had a broken mesh that could cause a crash.  
  - Changed Miraak's gloves from Clothing to Light Armor.  
  - Changed some settings for Show Player in Menu. Please stop reporting that your inventory models are broken. They aren't broken. They just aren't vanilla. This is a modded setup. Sometimes things aren't vanilla.

  I'm not 100% sure if the VioLens recording will "work" in a sense, since the new one just unbinds that hotkey. It's possible this may have to be done manually, but if nothing else, it shouldn't be an issue for newcomers to the list. Sorry if this is annoying for you guys.

- Disabled various bushes, rocks, plants, and trees that were otherwise interfering with doors and landscape edits.  
- Reinstalled and added various patches for Embers XD.  
- Added Screenshot Helper.  
- Removed Disable Snow Grass - For Vanilla and Cathedral Landscapes.  
- Removed Dynamic Things.  
- Added JS Shrines of the Divines.  
- Added Double Bright Quick Light.  
- Changed ENB screenshot key to Insert because it was pissing me off when I used Print Screen to take a screenshot and I would end up with two copies of every image.  
- Updated Dyndolod Output.  

Known issues that were fixed:  
 - Markarth, Morthal, Falkreath, Solitude Skyway, Blue Palace Courtyard, and many other locations should have greatly reduced jank and clipping and whatnot. This does NOT mean I cleared every location or got every instance of any object that's placed incorrectly, but I definitely got a lot of them. This is the sort of thing that will take a long time.  
 - Fire pits should no longer have missing textures.  
 - Blackthorn's initial note should no longer be riddled with typos and grammatical errors.  
 - Screenshots SHOULD save properly now, in your `Stock Game\[NoDelete]Screenshots` path.  

If any of the items listed above are NOT fixed, please notify me immediately. It's a lot for one person to check...
