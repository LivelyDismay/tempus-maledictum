# Preamble

---

### Tempus Maledictum

This is a list I made for myself, primarily to play a lot of quest mods that I've missed out on over the years.

Prefer to see a video on it? [No problem!](https://youtu.be/iWViHZ4_cYA )

The main attractions are obviously all the quest mods, as well as Legacy of the Dragonborn and Timelost Dwemer. Personally I prefer the Boat to Solitude start to get a faster LotD start-up, but that's just me, do whatever you want, I'm not your real dad.

**Support will be minimal.** I want to play this list myself instead of spending all my time fielding support queries. I hope you understand. I just want to have some fun. To that end, if you ask me questions already covered in the readme or the FAQ, I'm going to outright ignore you.

---

## Installation

---

### Pre-Installation

You need a legal copy of Skyrim Anniversary Edition through Steam, with all DLCs - yes, including the paid AE DLC. No, I won't make a version without the AE content.
 - If you haven't already done this since purchasing AE, launch the game through Steam and allow Skyrim to download all the Creation Club files.

These steps are only needed if you install this Modlist for the first time. If you update the Modlist, jump straight to [Updating](#updating).

#### Installing Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Packages

These packages are required for MO2, and you can download them from [Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads).

##### Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022

Download the x64 version under [Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#visual-studio-2015-2017-2019-and-2022).

[Direct Link](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) if you can't find it.

##### Visual Studio 2012 (VC++ 11.0) Update 4

Download the x64 version under [Visual Studio 2012 (VC++ 11.0) Update 4](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#visual-studio-2012-vc-110-update-4).

[Direct Link](https://download.microsoft.com/download/1/6/B/16B06F60-3B20-4FF2-B699-5E9B7962F9AE/VSU_4/vcredist_x64.exe) if you can't find it.

#### Steam Config

#### Change Steams Update Behavior

Skyrim may still be updated by Bethesda in the future. Whenever the game updates, the entire modding community goes silent for the next one or two weeks because some mods need to be updated to the latest game runtime version.

To ensure that Steam does not automatically updates the game for you, head over to the Properties window, navigate to the _Updates_ tab and change _Automatic updates_ to _Only update this game when I launch it_. You should also disable the Steam Cloud while you're at it.

#### Set the Game language to English

Just do it. This entire Modlist is in English and 99% of all mods you will find are also in English. I highly recommend playing the game in English and **I will not give support to people with a non-English game**. I really wish I could, but at this time, it simply isn't feasible.

Open the Steam Properties window, navigate to the _Language_ tab and select _English_ from the dropdown menu.

#### Clean Skyrim

I highly recommend uninstalling the game through Steam, deleting the game folder and reinstalling it. **Make sure you run the game once** to establish your registry path - otherwise, Wabbajack will be unable to locate the game directory, and thus cannot install the modlist.

### Using Wabbajack

---

#### Preparations

Let's get to the actual installation..

Grab the latest release of Wabbajack from [here](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/) (just click the big blue Download button). Place the `Wabbajack.exe` file in a blank folder at the root of a drive, such as `C:/Wabbajack`. Please do not put it in a Windows Protected Directory, such as Program Files or your Desktop.

Launch Wabbajack. The exe will download the rest of the program from Github and extract itself wherever you placed the exe. When it is finished extracting and installing itself, select the `Browse Modlists` option. Click the Download arrow for Tempus Maledictum, and you will be forwarded to the next screen when it is finished.

Set the `Installation Location` to a blank folder at the root of a drive, such as `D:\Tempus Maledictum`. The `Download Location` will update automatically. Again, please avoid using Windows Protected Directories. You may have the Installation and Download locations on separate drives if you prefer.

Click the `Play` arrow. If you have a Nexus Premium account, all of your downloads will be automated. Without Premium, you will need to manually click the Download button for each mod. Installation will be automated regardless of your account status.

### Problems with Wabbajack

There are a lot of different scenarios where Wabbajack will produce an error. I recommend re-running Wabbajack before posting anything. Wabbajack will continue where it left off so you lose no progress.

- **I'm having problems downloading a few files**

You almost certainly forgot to download the AE CC content, or you didn't buy it. Purchase the AE DLC from Steam, then launch the game to download the content. If this doesn't fix it, you'll have to pop on over to [my Discord server for live support.](https://discord.gg/yABEjwB)

- **Wabbajack could not find my game folder**:

Wabbajack will not work with a pirated version of the game. If you own the game on Steam, go back to the [Pre-Installation](#pre-installation) step.

---

## Updating

If this Modlist receives an update, please check the Changelog before doing anything. Always backup your saves or start a new game after updating.

Tempus Maledictum updates based on a [Semantic Versioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning) system.

Generally speaking:  
- Full x.0 (2.0, 3.0, etc) updates requires a new game.  
- Major x.x (2.1, 2.2 etc) updates requires a new game.  
- Minor x.x.x (2.1.1, 2.1.2) updates can be applied to an ongoing playthrough.

**Wabbajack will delete all files that are not part of the Modlist when updating!**

This means that any additional mods you have installed on top of the Modlist will be deleted. Your downloads folder will not be touched!

If you wish for Wabbajack to ignore any additional mods you've installed, rename them to say `[NoDelete]` at the beginning of the name.

Updating is like installing. You only have to make sure that you select the same path and tick the _overwrite existing Modlist_ button.

## Post Installation

This section [has been moved to its own page, just to really make it stand out in its importance.](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/main/wabbajack-stuff/TempusMaledictumReadmePostInstall.md)

---

## Controller Support

At the bottom of MO2, there is a separator named `Optional - Controller Support`. Enable this prior to launching SKSE and starting your game.  
If you already started your save prior to enabling this mod: exit the game, enable the optional controller support mod, launch the game, then open your MCM menus, scroll down to MCM Recorder, and run the Tempus v5 recording again.  

---

## Ultrawide Support

At the bottom of MO2, there is a separator named `Optional - Ultrawide Support`. Enable all mods in this section prior to launching SKSE through MO2 and playing your game.
