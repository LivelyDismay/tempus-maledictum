Remember that installation folder you chose for Wabbajack? Pop that guy open.

Scroll down and find `ModOrganizer.exe`. Launch it.

MO2 will open, along with all the mods, plugins, separators, and all that good stuff. **You don't have to do anything here.** Just make sure the bar on the right says `SKSE` and press `RUN`.

The game will launch. **It will probably take a minute or two to load.** Please have some patience here, it's loading a whole lot of stuff.

Start a New Game. You'll be in the Abandoned Prison. Create your character - I recommend the [Deep Elf race](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22499). If you don't want to play as a Deep Elf, that's totally fine - all the other races have [Imperious](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1315/) to make them a little more interesting, too. 

When you're done creating your character, you'll have a whole lot of messages scrolling through the top left corner.

**Wait in this cell until the messages stop.**

 - If you chose the Deep Elf race, you'll also get a prompt asking what kind of Smithing you'd like to start with.

Please pick up the book next to the Statue of Mara.  

When the messages in the top left corner have stopped, speak to the Statue of Mara and choose how you'd like to start the game. Some notable entries:

 - **Arrived by ship: Solitude** - gives you the option to kickstart the Legacy of the Dragonborn questline.
 - **Museum Guildmaster** - kickstart the Legacy of the Dragonborn questline in a bit of a different way.
 - **Camping in the Woods** - start at a campsite outside of Helgen. Basically the vanilla intro but without all the jank.

Of course, you can choose any option that sounds good to you. Some of them will be a lot harder than others, so consider yourself warned.

You'll get some pop-ups welcoming you to the list. Your MCMs are done for you once you get these pop-ups. Yay.  

Once you choose your start, sleep in the bed to begin the game.

You'll get a prompt for Religion once you step outside. Read through the options and choose whichever you like - or none at all. You can change your selection at any time via visiting shrines or reading certain books, so don't feel like you're locked into a singular option.

I think that about covers it. Enjoy the game, I hope you have fun, and as always - don't forget to [read the FAQ](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/main/wabbajack-stuff/TempusMaledictumReadmeFAQ.md).
