## Tempus Maledictum Frequently Asked Questions



---

#### Where are my ingredients and crafting materials?

Press right alt. This is from [Handy Crafting](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59258).

---

#### Can I add/remove [x] mod?

If you have to ask, then the answer is no. If you want to learn, please use the #tempus-rule-11 channel in [my Discord server](https://discord.gg/yABEjwB). DO NOT use the #tempus-support channel for questions about altering the modlist.

---

#### Everything is too bright, can you make it have some sort of *realistic immersive darkness?*

No. It's a video game. I want to see shit.

---

#### Everything is too dark, can I brighten it up somehow?

Shift+Enter to open the ENB GUI. Adjust as you see fit. When you're done, click Save Configuration. Shift+Enter again to close the ENB GUI.

---

#### My night eye/vampire sight/etc powers don't work.

Yeah, ENBs tend to do that. Press `Shift+Enter`, navigate to the righthand column of the ENB GUI, expand the `ENBEFFECT.FX` section, and enable the option that states `Use Nigheye Fix`. Then, in the lefthand column, click `Save Configuration`, then click `Apply Configuration`. Press `Shift+Enter` again to close the ENB GUI.

---

#### There is a white flash when I shout/use powers/etc.

This means you turned on the Nighteye Fix above. Turn it back off using the same instructions above, except now you're disabling it instead of enabling it. Don't forget to Save+Apply.

---

#### Is the world unleveled?

No.

---

#### What ENB is in this list?

Culminated ENB.

---

#### EnaiRim or SimonRim?

Enai.

---

#### Legacy of the Dragonborn?

Yes.

---

#### How do I start the Goldenhills Plantation CC stuff?

You need to be level 15, then speak with an innkeeper in either Whiterun or Rorikstead. They will have a line of dialogue about work in the area.

---

#### How do I dodge / what are the hotkeys in the MCMS?

Tempus Maledictum makes liberal use of MCM Recorder. This means most things are set up for you. To help you along, here are some of the default hotkeys I use:

Toggle HUD - Mouse3.  
Dodge - Mouse4.  
Target Lock-on - F. (You can long-press F to change POV).  
Target Lock-on Swap - Mouse Wheel + Mouse movement. A bit less sensitive than the default value (32 > 50).  
Sneak - Left Control.  
Hold Shift - allows you to pick up books without reading them. Also lets you know if that book will be stolen or not.  
Right Alt - access Handy Crafting storage.  
G: Execute stunned enemies.  
X: Quick trade with your companions. 
Hold E or press L: Quick light.
