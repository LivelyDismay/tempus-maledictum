### Launching Mod Organizer 2

Remember that installation folder you chose for the modlist when you launched the Wabbajack app? It's when I recommended a blank folder at the root of a drive, such as `D:/Tempus Maledictum`. Pop that guy open.

Scroll down and find `ModOrganizer.exe`. Launch it.

MO2 will open, along with all the mods, plugins, separators, and all that good stuff. **You don't have to do anything here.**

### Setting Up Optional Controller, Ultrawide, & Survival Support

If you plan to play Survival Mode, double click the separator that reads `Optionals & INI Overrides`, then enable the `Survival Mode INI - Enabled` mod.

I don't use a controller or own Ultrawide. If someone wants to write up guides/configs on these things that are known to work, I'm happy to include them here. Until then, I'm sorry to say you're on your own.

### Starting a New Game

When you're all set up and ready to go, make sure the top right bar reads `SKSE` and press `Run.`

The game will launch. **It will probably take a minute or two to load.** Please have some patience here, it's loading a whole lot of stuff.

Start a New Game. You'll be in the Abandoned Prison. Create your character - I recommend the [Deep Elf race](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22499). If you don't want to play as a Deep Elf, that's totally fine - all the other races have [Imperious](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1315/) to make them a little more interesting, too. 

When you're done creating your character, you'll have a whole lot of messages scrolling through the top right corner.  **Wait in this cell until the messages stop.**  You'll also get a number of pop-ups. Please read them.

You have a Tempus Maledictum Beginner's Guide in your inventory. Please read this.

There is a Spellforge behind you, alongside a chest with some goodies and a Spellforge Manual. This manual, alongside the Beginner's Guide, will help you learn how to use this. You don't have to use this right now; there are more Spellforges in the world if you just want to get started with the game.

When the messages in the top right corner have stopped, speak to the Statue of Mara and choose how you'd like to start the game. Some notable entries:

 - **Arrived by ship: Solitude** - gives you the option to kickstart the Legacy of the Dragonborn questline.
 - **Museum Guildmaster** - kickstart the Legacy of the Dragonborn questline in a bit of a different way - this is largely used for returning players that want to skip some of the beginning LotD quests.
 - **Camping in the Woods** - start at a campsite outside of Helgen. Basically the vanilla intro but without all the jank.

Of course, you can choose any option that sounds good to you. Some of them will be a lot harder than others, so consider yourself warned.

You may also notice two starts are missing: the vanilla start and the Vampire Lord start. The vanilla start is quite buggy in a heavily modded set-up, as the entire scene is scripted and prone to issues. The Vampire Lord start *can* still be played via the Surprise Me option, but your spells won't work in VL form until you save/load the game. I think this is a shitty way for players to start the game (encountering a bug right away) so I've opted to yeet it from the list of selections.

Once you choose your start, sleep in the bed to begin the game.

### Please Read the FAQ

No modlist is perfect. Not only that, but there's no way you'll know all of the mods in this list. As such, I urge you to please [read the FAQ](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/tempus-maledictum/blob/main/faq.md). A lot of common questions are answered here.
